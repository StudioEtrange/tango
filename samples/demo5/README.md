## Notes on volumes

* Named volumes
    * One volume named `vol1` is created pointing to `/tmp` on host because of `vol1#VOL1_PATH`
    * One volume named `vol2` is created pointing to `$HOME` on host because of `vol2:$HOME`

* Volumes mapping
    * Inside cloud9 `/workspace` is mapped to `$HOME` on host because of `$HOME:/workspace`
    * Inside cloud9 `/bar` is mapped to `/tmp` on host because of `vol1:/bar`
    * Inside cloud9 `/internal_home` is mapped to `$HOME` on host because of `vol2#MY_INTERNAL_HOME`
