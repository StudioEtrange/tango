    * https://github.com/zadam/trilium
    * https://github.com/BaptisteBdn/docker-selfhosted-apps/tree/main/trilium

* Seafile

    * https://book.veloren.net/
    * https://veloren.net/
    * https://gitlab.com/veloren/veloren

* Gate One
  * https://github.com/liftoff/GateOne/
  * Gate One is an HTML5-powered terminal emulator and a web SSH client

* Mosh
  * https://mosh.org/
  * https://github.com/mobile-shell/mosh
  * Mosh is a remote terminal application that supports intermittent connectivity, allows roaming, and provides speculative local echo and line editing of user keystrokes.
  * How it works : The mosh program will SSH to user@host to establish the connection. SSH may prompt the user for a password or use public-key authentication to log in. From this point, mosh runs the mosh-server process (as the user) on the server machine. The server process listens on a high UDP port and sends its port number and an AES-128 secret key back to the client over SSH. The SSH connection is then shut down and the terminal session begins over UDP.


* Puter
  * https://github.com/HeyPuter/puter
  * web desktop
  * Puter is an advanced, open-source internet operating system designed to be feature-rich, exceptionally fast, and highly extensible. It can be used to build remote desktop environments or serve as an interface for cloud storage services, remote servers, web hosting platforms, and more.

* ente
  * https://github.com/ente-io/ente
  * Fully open source, End to End Encrypted alternative to Google Photos and Apple Photos

## Various

* [ ] pb to access through ipv6 ?
    * some doc : https://github.com/traefik/traefik/issues/8789 https://github.com/traefik/traefik/pull/9183
    * STEPS TO TRY :
        * create a docker network "traafik_network" un reseau dediÃ© a traefik en ipv6only and with "ip6tables": true to map traefik exposed ports to docker host ipv6 adress
        * create a docker network "default_network" with ipv4only dedicated to tango services ?
        * attach traefik to the two network
        * "traafik_network" ipv6 adress can be set with only local ipv6 adress (ULA)
        * "ip6tables": true docker option when activated to manage nat port between the IPV6 docker host adress and the IPV6 container adressses 
        * https://docs.docker.com/config/daemon/ipv6/
        * docker daemon setup
            * dockerd --ipv6 --fixed-cidr-v6 fd11:2233:4455:6677::/64 --ip6tables
            OR update /etc/docker/daemon.json:
            {
                "experimental": true,
                "ipv6": true,
                "ip6tables": true,
                "fixed-cidr-v6": "fd11:2233:4455:6677::/64" #  "fixed-cidr-v6": "fd00::/80"
            }
        * docker network create -d bridge --ipv6 


* [ ] BUG when using in tango env file 
    * TEST=\
    * problem with  TEST=\ : single \ in compose env file it become TEST='\' and \' make docker compose to throw an error


* [ ] tango plugin restriction
    * each plugin can work 
        * only on some specific services
        * may require app lib
        * may require stella
        * may require some var init in tango init or mambo init
        * TODO implement restriction system on plugin, which may work only if certains criteria are ok


* [ ] migrate from docker-compose (v1.x) to "docker compose" (v2.x)
    * https://docs.docker.com/compose/cli-command-compatibility/
    * install method linux : https://github.com/docker/compose (report it to stella)

* [ ] 2022 07 when in shared mode (TANGO_INSTANCE_MODE=shared) and launching a SAME service in two isolated context, the first launched service is deleted when launching the second
    ```
    cd $HOME
    export TANGO_INSTANCE_MODE=shared
    mkdir ctx1
    mkdir ctx2
    cd tango
    ./tango --ctx ctx1 --ctxroot $HOME/ctx1 --module firefox  --domain chimere-harpie.org --freeport up firefox
    ./tango --ctx ctx2 --ctxroot $HOME/ctx2 --module firefox  --domain chimere-harpie.org --freeport up firefox 
    ```

* [ ] implementation of __set_priority_router_all force TANGO_SUBSERVICES_ROUTER to have same family subrouter following each other in the list - REVIEW the implementation

* [X] add by default traefik service ? its is added because traefik is a depency of all compose service
    * [-] each time we relaunch a single service, traefik is recreated --- is this a problem ? --- use --no-recreate ?
    
* [ ] modules env file before/after app env file ?

* [X] default area network for module and services : main

* [X] upgrade traefik 2.1 to 2.2.x https://docs.traefik.io/migration/v2/
* [-] HTTP to HTTPS https://docs.traefik.io/routing/entrypoints/ 
    * cannot choose a redirection on each router because the redirect apply to https but cannot choose which port when there is several entrypoint
    * see https://www.reddit.com/r/Booksonic/comments/jsbf00/booksonic_docker_guide_detailed_for_newbie/gc14yvp/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3 ? https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/middlewares/redirectscheme/ ==> PB : redirect http to https on which port => MUST depend on the entrypoint

* [ ] make some default configuration on entrypoint https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/routing/entrypoints/
    * http.redirection entrypoint priority ?
    * tls ?

* [ ] secure traefik headers
    * https://mediacenterz.com/ultimate-docker-home-server-avec-traefik-2-letsencrypt-et-oauth-2020/
    * https://blog.lapaire.org/update-traefik-v2-4-to-v2-5/
    * https://github.com/htpcBeginner/docker-traefik/blob/master/appdata/traefik2/rules/web/middlewares.yml.example

* [ ] scripts are sourced when exec => they should not be ? => to inehrit the env var of tango context ? (which is by the way the only main purpose of this 'script' functionality) ==> DEPRECATE script usage ?

* [X] remove script_init ? (scripts init are always launched with a predefined image) do we really need this as we used ansible in mambo and in init phase we often need to control docker itself and its not really easy to control it from inside a container ?

* [ ] Add possibility to reverse proxy to an http link instead of a service 
    * https://gist.github.com/StudioEtrange/c6bb41732063b0151adf5ef592768348

* [ ] Catch Error 502 while getting external IP in tango_set_context.sh
    ```TANGO_EXTERNAL_IP="$(__tango_curl -s ipinfo.io/ip)"```

* [X] error service : exclude non HTTP router in entrypoints list `TRAEFIK_ENTRYPOINTS_LIST` which is used in compose file here : `"traefik.http.routers.error.entrypoints=${TRAEFIK_ENTRYPOINTS_LIST}"`
